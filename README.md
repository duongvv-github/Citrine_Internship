# Citrine_Internship

This is a repository with my code for an internship application at Citrine Informatics in Redwood City, CA. I did not get the internship.

The code is organized such that the parent directory includes all my scratchwork. Inside the 'submission' folder is the streamlined code along with a report I wrote up for the application.

The code is broke down into 1.x where I import the data, 1.5 where I create a mean value regressor to serve as a baseline model, 2.x where I use a multiple linear regression, and 3.x where I use a random forest regression model. 

If I had more time and energy, I would like to add more fluorinated examples. From a data science perspective, I would want to investigate the overfitting based on the DFT contribution, as noted in the report.
