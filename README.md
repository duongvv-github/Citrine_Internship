# Citrine_Internship

This is a repository with my code for an internship application at Citrine Informatics in Redwood City, CA. I did not get the internship.

The code is organized such that the parent directory includes all my scratchwork. Inside the 'submission' folder is the streamlined code along with a report I wrote up for the application.
