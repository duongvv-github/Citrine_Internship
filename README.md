This is a repository with my code for modeling the magnetic moment of a molecule based on the some theory data. I also used it to apply for an internship application at Citrine Informatics in Redwood City, CA.

The code is organized such that the parent directory includes all my scratchwork. Inside the 'submission' folder is the streamlined code along with a report I wrote up for the application.

The code is broke down into 1.x where I import the data, 1.5 where I create a mean value regressor to serve as a baseline model, 2.x where I use a multiple linear regression, and 3.x where I use a random forest regression model. 

If I had more time and energy, I would like to add more fluorinated examples. From a data science perspective, I would want to investigate the overfitting based on the DFT contribution, as noted in the report.
